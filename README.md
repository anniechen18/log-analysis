# log-analysis

Basic Log Analyzer inspired by an assignment from CIS194.
Spec: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/hw/02-ADTs.pdf

To run:
`stack build`
`stack ghci`

That should load the executables into the interactive environment. To test out functions, run:
`testParse parse 10 "error.log"`
